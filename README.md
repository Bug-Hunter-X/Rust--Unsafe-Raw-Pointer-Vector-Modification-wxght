This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe raw pointers and vectors.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a vector's elements directly via a raw pointer, leading to potential memory corruption or panics. The `bugSolution.rs` file offers a safer and more idiomatic approach, emphasizing Rust's memory safety features.
